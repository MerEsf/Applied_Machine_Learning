## Assignment 4: Predicting Property Maintenance Fines in Detroit
### Goal: 
Understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket
### Dataset:
Detroit Open Data Portal (https://data.detroitmi.gov/)
### Approach: 
Predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time (the probability that the corresponding blight ticket will be paid on time) using random forest classifer
### Evaluation: 
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

## Assignment 3: Evaluation
### Goal:
