## Week 4 Assignment: Predicting Property Maintenance Fines in Detroit
### Goal: 
Understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket
### Dataset:
Detroit Open Data Portal (https://data.detroitmi.gov/)
### Approach: 
Predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time (he probability that the corresponding blight ticket will be paid on time) using random forest classifer
### Evaluation: 
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

## Week 3 Assignment: Evaluation
### Goal: 
Train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud
### Dataset:
Kaggle Fraud Dataset
### Approach:
Support Vector classifier, Logisitic Regression classifier

## Week 2 Assignment: Model Complexity and Generalization Performance
### Dataset:
 UCI Mushroom Data Set(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom?ref=datanews.io)
